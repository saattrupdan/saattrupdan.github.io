This project aims to classify the category of scientific papers, based on the subject classification on [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org).


## [athelstan](https://github.com/saattrupdan/athelstan)

This project was a first attempt at a cluster analysis of constituencies in England and Wales based on eight different variables related to demographics, business, qualifications and amenities. A use case would be to find similar constituencies as a given location in one of these two countries.

All data has been downloaded [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.org.uk), and data on consituencies and their latitudes and longitudes are from [doogal.co.uk](https://www.doogal.co.uk).

This project was the capstone project in the IBM applied data science specialisation on Coursera.
