title: The Poisson distribution
---

In these first few posts I'll cover a few common distributions and note their interesting properties. I'll try to follow standard notation here, so that capital letters $X,Y,Z$ will denote random variables, which are represented as functions $X:\Omega\to\mathbb R$ for some sample probability space $\Omega$. $P(A)$ will be the probability of event $A$ and, as is custom, I will abuse notation and write things like $P(X=0)$ for $P(\{x\mid X(x)=0\})$.

The Poisson distribution is a very popular distribution for modelling discrete data. This distribution is used when we're dealing with a large amount of Bernoulli trials spread over time, each with a very small success rate, and we're then counting the number of successes in a particular time interval. The Poisson has a single parameter $\lambda$, which is how many trials are performed at every time unit.

```python
from scipy.stats import poisson
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from random import uniform
import numpy as np

N = 50 # number of time intervals
mus = [uniform(0, N) for i in range(10)] # defining 10 uniformly random values for mu
Xs = map(poisson, mus) # defining Poisson distributed random variables for every value of mu
xs = range(N+1) # the x values in our distributions

# create a (2,5) grid of subplots, sharing x- and y-axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 5, sharex='col', sharey='row', figsize=(15,4))

# fill in every subplot with the density (pmf) of the random variables
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(5):
        ax[i,j].bar(xs, next(Xs).pmf(xs))
        ax[i,j].title.set_text(f"mu = {round(mus[i*5+j],2)}")

# set overall title and show the plot
fig.suptitle("Poisson distribution for various values of mu", fontsize=20, y=1.1)
plt.show()
```
