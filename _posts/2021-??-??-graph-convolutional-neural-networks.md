As more and more businesses strive toward becoming data-driven, the use of
graph methods for storing relational data has been on the rise (

[2](https://www.business-of-data.com/articles/graph-databases),
[3](https://www.eweek.com/database/why-experts-see-graph-databases-headed-to-mainstream-use/)).
Along with these graph databases comes more opportunities for analysing the
data, including the use of predictive machine learning models on graphs.

The current machine learning models currently used to model graphs are all
variants of the so-called *graph convolutional neural network*, abbreviated
GCNs, so covering that seems a good place to start!

## A Recap on Convolutional Neural Networks

As the name suggests, the graph **convolutional** neural networks are related
to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This connection turns out to be a bit
contrived, but we will get to that later. In any case, to make the analogue
clear, let's briefly go over how CNNs work
