I'm Dan, a Mathematician and Data Scientist.

I grew up in Denmark and did a Master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Copenhagen (6 months of which was on an Erasmus exchange at the University of Leeds, UK). I returned to the UK after my MSc, this time around to do a PhD in Mathematical Logic at the University of Bristol.

For more detailed information please see my [resume](/img/resume.pdf).
