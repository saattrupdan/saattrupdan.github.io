title: About me
---

I am a final year PhD candidate in Mathematical Logic at the University of Bristol, and am interested in the interaction between machines and human language. I am currently developing a natural language processing add-on to [StandardsRepo](https://www.standardsrepo.com/), a word processing web app made for large scale collaboration on technical documents.

For more detailed information please see my [resume](/img/resume.pdf).
